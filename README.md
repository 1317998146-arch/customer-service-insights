# customer-service-insights
A data-driven analysis project based on real customer service scenarios.
## Project Overview

This project simulates a customer service / after-sales data analysis scenario.

The goal is not to showcase complex SQL syntax, but to demonstrate how data can be used to:
- Understand ticket volume distribution
- Identify common customer issues
- Explore potential efficiency bottlenecks in service operations

The analysis is designed to reflect real-world business questions and decision-making contexts,
rather than isolated SQL exercises.
## Key Business Questions

This project aims to answer practical business questions such as:

- How many customer service tickets are created over time?
- Are there noticeable peaks or patterns in ticket volume?
- What types of issues appear most frequently?
- Are there signs of inefficiency in response or resolution timelines?

These questions reflect common concerns in customer support and service operations.
