# customer-service-insights
A data-driven analysis project based on real customer service scenarios.
## Project Overview

This project simulates a customer service / after-sales data analysis scenario.

The goal is not to showcase complex SQL syntax, but to demonstrate how data can be used to:
- Understand ticket volume distribution
- Identify common customer issues
- Explore potential efficiency bottlenecks in service operations

The analysis is designed to reflect real-world business questions and decision-making contexts,
rather than isolated SQL exercises.
